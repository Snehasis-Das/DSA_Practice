DSA Practice Compilation (C++)

This repository is a foundational DSA practice compilation written in C++, created specifically for placement preparation and LeetCode-style problem solving.

Instead of solving complete problems directly, this repository focuses on building reusable algorithmic and language-level building blocks that are repeatedly required while coding interview problems.

🎯 Purpose

1. Build strong C++ fundamentals for DSA
2. Eliminate syntax and STL hesitation during interviews
3. Practice sub-problems (sorting, searching, traversal, patterns)
4. Develop muscle memory before attempting LeetCode problems

This approach ensures that when solving problems, the focus stays on logic, not implementation details.

🛠️ How to Use This Repo

1. Clone the repository
2. Compile any file individually:

    g++ filename.cpp -std=c++17

3. Run and experiment by modifying inputs and logic
4. Do not rush — understanding is the goal

📌 Philosophy

    “Don’t memorize solutions.
    Build the tools that create solutions.”

By the time all phases are completed, most LeetCode problems reduce to pattern recognition + composition.

📚 Language & Tools

1. Language: C++17
2. Focus: DSA + Interview Readiness
3. Style: Clean, minimal, reusable
